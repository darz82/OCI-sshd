# For sshd user authentication via ChallengeResponse method
# Invokes the base-auth as substack so that the password results
# (if successful) will still allow processing of the 2FA
# via pam_google_authenticator.so.
# nullok allows bypassing of 2FA if the user home directory
# does not have a .google_authenticator configuration setup

# There does not seem to be a convenient way to configure userauth
# with (publickey+Authenticator) without including the password step,
# as PAM enforces the whole stack. Customizing a stack to pull this off
# runs the risk of bypassing password check altogether, and may
# accidentally result in a config that permits token-only to succeed.
